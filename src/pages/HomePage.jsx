                    <p> Happy Anniversary!</p>
                    <p>As a fun surprise for our 1st anniversary, I put together an escape room. Similar to the one I put together for our first dating anniversary.</p>
                    <p> There is still a great deal of puzzle pieces that must be done by hand (so you'll see the gift I'm giving you now/soon)</p>
                    <p> Thank you for your patience while I worked on this after work while you tried to sleep next to me. </p>
                    <p> I tried using React app so that I could 1) refine my skills and 2) include hints into the UI </p>
                    <p> If you run into any issues, let me know and I can try to fix them. </p>
                    <p> But without further ado! Welcome to the challenge!!! Let me set the scene... </p>
                    <p> I've decided to surprise you with a cruise! But before we can enjoy the trip, we have to actually get there, right? </p>
