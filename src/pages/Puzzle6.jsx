                    <p>Sheepishly, she says, "I can't remember of the top of my head. BUT I know that I had a note in my suitcase about it!"</p>
                    <p> As you unpack the suitcase, you notice 5 mazes at the top. </p>
                    <p> But you also  know that all the docks are just 3 digits </p>
                    <p> You ask Victoria about it and she says "All I know was I liked that the numbers were in descending order. You know, biggest first." </p>
                    <p> With a chuckle on a person on vacation can manager in a situation like this, you start trying to figure out the dock number. </p>
