                    <p> this time the riddle is in the form of a picture with cruise ships + a little circle with a cruise ship cutout </p>
                    <p>She says "This time it's on purpose. I wanted to help you find your way AROUND the ship"</p>
                    <p> With that fun little pun, what door do you want to try? </p>
